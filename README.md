# _LibreAssistant:_ A FLOSS clone of ChatGPT

In recent months [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) becoming the number one trend of the internet has alerted a lot of FLOSS advocates or enthusiasts (like me) and most of open source implementations are simply open source wrappers on OpenAI's original API. So as ambitious as it may seem, I have decided to make an implementation of ChatGPT, which at the time called _Libre Assistant_ using __only__ open source tools and models.
