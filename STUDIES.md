## Introduction

In order to have a generic generative chatbot like _ChatGPT_ what we need is a language model. Language models are usually trained on a certain language and they do their job pretty well on that particular language, so in order to get a good result we also may need to fine-tune that model. In this documet, some of famous models such as BLOOM, BLOOMZ and OPT are reviewed and their pros and cons are listed. In this document, we simply check the functionality of the model and _how easy it is to fine-tune them_.
